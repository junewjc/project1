# Dance Studio Website
Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

My project is to make a website for a company called Latin Dance Studio. 
The company offers dance courses for 3 different types of latin dance at its dance studio. 
The company’s goal is to increase the number of sign ups for its trial classes and courses through its website.

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://junewjc.github.io/project1/)

## UX
The primary users of the website are: 
- Potential customers who wish to know more about the dance courses offered.
- Existing customers who wish to view the course schedule or to sign up for new courses after completing the current course.

### User Stories
- As a potential customer, I want to view information on the dance studio and its instructors so that I can know who is - teaching the dance courses.
- As a potential customer, I want to fill up a form so that I can register for a trial class or course. I would also want to be able to select multiple levels (such as Bachata Level 1 and Bachata Level 2) for the courses so that I can reserve a spot for the next level while I am taking lessons for current level.
- As a potential customer, I want to view information the opening hours and address of the dance studio so that I know when and how to go to the studio. 
- As a potential or existing customer, I want to know details such as prices, duration and difficulty of the courses offered so that I know which course is suitable for me.
- As a potential or existing customer, I want to view the company’s social media pages such as Facebook and Instagram so that I can follow and be updated about the company’s events.
- As a potential or existing customer, I want to view contact details of the company such as phone number and email so that I can contact them easily when I have any enquires.
- As an existing customer, I want to know the schedule of the upcoming lessons so that I can plan ahead.
- As an existing customer, I want to fill up a form so that I can register for another course after I have completed the current one.
- As the company owner, I want to inform people that my company offers free trial classes so that I can attract more potential customers. 

In order to help the primary users achieve their goals, I have decided to include the following sections on the website:

1. About us - to give users a basic introduction of the company
2. Instructors - to let the users know more about the dance instructors 
3. Courses - to provide details on the courses offered and its prices
4. Schedule - to show an overview of the upcoming lessons in a calendar 
5. Registration - to allow users to sign up for trial classes or courses by filling up a form
6. Contact us - to provide details such as the studio’s address, opening hours, contact number and email address
7. Social media - to provide links to the company’s social media pages such as Facebook and Instagram
8. Free trial class - to show users that the company provides free trial classes 

When designing the website, my main focus is to make it user-friendly for the primary users and to attract people’s attention by choosing a suitable colour theme for the website. 

I have chose to use red in monochromatic shades for the website. I feel that red is a suitable colour as it is an eye-catching colour which represents the fun, energy and passion of the dance studio. 

The mockup I have done during the design process is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xkv8Dy2PKgCtYSMH9S-jFpyEWjfnz91T0YV6vxVrvKw/edit?usp=sharing)
